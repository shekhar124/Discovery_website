                Discovery, Inc. is an American multinational mass media factual television conglomerate based in New York City.
                Established in 1985, the company primarily operates a group of factual and lifestyle television brands, such as

                adding networks such as Food Network, Asian Food Network, HGTV, and Travel Channel to its portfolio. Since the purchase,
                Discovery has described itself as serving members of "passionate" audiences, and has also placed a larger focus on streaming services
                built around its properties, such as Discovery+.Discovery also owns or has interests in local versions of its channel brands
                in international markets, in addition to its other major regional operations such as Eurosport (a pan-European group of sports channels,
                 most prominently the rightsholder of the Olympic Games throughout most of Europe), GolfTV (an international golf-focused streaming service,
                  which is the international digital rightsholder of the PGA Tour), Discovery Communications Nordic (which operates general-interest channels in Norway,
                   Sweden, Denmark and Finland), TVN Group in Poland, and a portfolio of various free-to-air channels in Germany, Italy, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.

                    Through this program, Discover Animals provides an ever-expanding guide to the world's animals for people seeking scientific information as well as personal appreciation and enjoyment. It uses multimedia and refers to numerous and diverse animal-related resources.
                    
                    Pet Guide
                    A primary objective of Discover Animals is to provide useful and supportive information to pet enthusiasts about animal care, training, behavior and responsible pet ownership practices, with guides for dogs, cats, birds, aquatics, herps and small animals. The pet guides feature a full list of dog and cat breeds with additional information about breed-specific traits.

                    Plants are predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes of the kingdom Plantae. Historically, the plant kingdom encompassed all living things that were not animals, and included algae and fungi; however, all current definitions of Plantae exclude the fungi and some algae, as well as the prokaryotes (the archaea and bacteria).

                     Most plants are multicellular organisms. Green plants obtain most of their energy from sunlight via photosynthesis by primary chloroplasts that are derived from endosymbiosis with cyanobacteria. Their chloroplasts contain chlorophylls a and b, which gives them their green color. Some plants are parasitic or mycotrophic and have lost the ability to produce normal amounts of chlorophyll or to photosynthesize, but still have flowers, fruits, and seeds. Plants are characterized by sexual reproduction and alternation of generations, although asexual reproduction is also common.
